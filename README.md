# Front-End Assessment: Task Manager (Vanilla JS)

## 📌 Overview
Build a functional **Task Manager** application using only **Vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS**. No frameworks (Vue, React, etc.) or libraries (jQuery) are allowed. We want to see your core JavaScript skills and UI/UX taste.

---

## 🛠 Functional Requirements
1.  **Add Task**: Users should be able to type a task and add it to the list.
2.  **Task Categories**: Each task must have a category (e.g., "Work", "Personal", "Urgent") chosen from a dropdown during creation.
3.  **Complete/Delete**: Users can mark tasks as "Done" (styling should change) or remove them entirely.
4.  **Persistent Storage**: Tasks must remain in the list even if the page is **refreshed** (use `localStorage`).

---

## 📋 The "Logic" Challenge (Filtering)
To test your JS logic, implement a **Filter System**:
* Add a filter (e.g., dropdown or tabs) to show: **"All"**, **"Completed"**, or **"Pending"** tasks.
* Add a second filter to show tasks by their **Category**.

---

## 🎨 Design & UI
* The app should be centered and look modern (clean typography, nice spacing).
* The layout must be responsive (should look good on mobile).
* Add a simple animation or transition when a task is added or deleted.

---

## 🚀 Technical Constraints
* Use **ES6+ features** (let/const, arrow functions, array methods like `.filter()`, `.map()`, or `.reduce()`).
* Clean DOM manipulation (no `innerHTML` for adding complex elements if possible; use `createElement`).
* No CSS frameworks (Bootstrap, Tailwind, etc.) – write your own CSS.
